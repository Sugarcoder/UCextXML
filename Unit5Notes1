XSL
- created by using XML markup language
- can format and display XML documents just like CSS does


--------XSL Components--------

XSLT (XSL Transformation)

- A language implemented in XML and used to process multiple XML documents
- It is supported by web browsers 
- For formatting and presentation, it can use CSS, which is supported by most browsers


XSL-FO (XSL Formatting Object)
- A language implemented in XML and used to format and present XML documents
- useful for styling and displaying XML documents
- Recommended for printing or viewing by W3C



--------How XSL Works---------

Typical XSL application: 
- XML document -> XSLT -> XSL-FO (XML instance) -> XSL-FO (presentation) -> PDF


How XSL works? 
- It processes all the nodes in the XML document tree based on the specific pattern matching


Pattern Matching
- It is the process of using patterns to find the node in the tree, and apply the XSL style sheet to that node


XSL Processor
- The XSL processor analyzes the template and associated patterns to process XSL style sheets for different parts of the tree


Result Tree
- When rules of the temple is applied to the contents of the element, the result is generated to a tree called "Result Tree". 
- The result might contain XML, HTML, text, or XSL-FO.


XML to XSL Transformation
- If the Result Tree contains XML, that means there is transformation of one form of XML to another. 


XML to HTML (XHTML)
- If the Result Tree contains HTML, there is transformation of XML to HTML
- XHTML can be viewed in a browser


XML to Text Transformation
- If a Result Tree contains text, then it transforms from XML to Text.


XSL Processor Logic
- Returns compleged Result Tree
- Display in browser: Result Tree might be ready for display in a browser if it is XHTML. If it is XML, then we might use CSS or XSL-FO to prepare it for display.
