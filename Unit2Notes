- Data Modeling = The process of creating schema to describe XML document

- Schema = A set of rules which describe elements and entities

Example: 

- In a RealEstate.xml file, you specify elements like address, house and rooms. 

- The name, term and type which you specify to verify your new XML verification is called the schema of your XML.


- Different schema languages: Documnt Type Definition (DTD) and XML Schema Definition (XSD).

DTD Example: 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!ELEMENT vehicle (car+)>
<!ELEMENT car (tire)>
<!ATTLIST car name CDATA #REQUIRED>
<!ATTLIST car model CDATA #REQUIRED>



XSD: 

- Used to create schema for XML document. 
- It has the same purpose as DTD except is much easier to understand
- It defines the data type for the elements for different types, such as text, integer, number, date, etc.


XSD Example: 

- <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xsd:schema xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org">
<xsd:element name="book">
	<xsd:complexType>
		<xsd:sequrence>
			<Xsd:element name="name" type="xsd:string" />
		</xsd:sequence>
	</xsd:complexType>
</xsd:element>
</xsd:schema>
